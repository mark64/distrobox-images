# Distrobox Images

This repo contains docker images I build for my own development purposes.

I use [distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox) to manage my dev environments.
This allows me to have a fully-reproducible and minimal environment, rather than letting
my machine gradually accumulate packages from years of use.

This is helpful for setting up new machines, transferring work to cloud instances, and
backing up only the files I need.
